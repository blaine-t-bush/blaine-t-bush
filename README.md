Hej! I’m Blaine: full-stack developer, data analyst, scientist, researcher, nerd, and curious person. I currently work at Avalon Innovation as a software development consultant. Prior to that, I worked at MAGNA Global as a research engineer for their Media Trials team, and as a graduate student researcher in Professor Nick Curro's lab at University of California, Davis.
